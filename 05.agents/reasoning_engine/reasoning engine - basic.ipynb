It gives you the flexibility to choose how much reasoning you want to delegate to the LLM and how much you want to handle with customized code. You can define Python functions that get used as tools via [Gemini Function Calling](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/function-calling). Reasoning Engine integrates closely with the Python SDK for the Gemini model in Vertex AI, and it can manage prompts, agents, and examples in a modular way.
