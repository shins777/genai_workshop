(PV) cells. PV cells are made of materials that produce excited electrons when exposed to light. These electrons flow through a circuit and produce direct current (DC) electricity, which can be used to power various devices or be stored in batteries. Solar panels are also known as solar cell panels, solar electric panels, or PV modules.\\nSolar panels are usually arranged in groups called arrays or systems. A photovoltaic system consists of one or more solar panels, an inverter that converts DC electricity to alternating current (AC) electricity, and sometimes other components such as controllers, meters, and trackers. Most panels are in solar farms or rooftop solar panels which  supply the electricity grid\\nSome advantages of solar panels are that they use a renewable and clean source of energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lower electricity bills. Some disadvantages are that they depend on the availability and intensity of sunlight, require cleaning, and have high initial costs. Solar panels are widely used for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes, as well as in space, often together with batteries.\\n\\n',\n"," 'Renewable energy (or green energy) is energy from renewable natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale. The most widely used renewable energy types are solar energy, wind power, and hydropower. Bioenergy and geothermal power are also significant in some countries. Some also consider nuclear power a renewable power source, although this is controversial. Renewable energy installations can be large or small and are suited for both urban and rural areas. Renewable energy is often deployed together with further electrification. This has several benefits: electricity can move heat and vehicles efficiently and is clean at the point of consumption. Variable renewable energy sources are those that have a fluctuating nature, such as wind power and solar power. In contrast, controllable renewable energy sources include dammed hydroelectricity, bioenergy, or geothermal power.\\n\\nRenewable energy systems have rapidly become more efficient and cheaper over the past 30 years. A large majority of worldwide newly installed electricity capacity is now renewable. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, have seen significant cost reductions over the past decade, making them more competitive with traditional fossil fuels. In most countries, photovoltaic solar or onshore wind are the cheapest new-build electricity. From 2011 to 2021, renewable energy grew from 20% to 28% of global electricity supply. Power from the sun and wind accounted for most of this increase, growing from a combined 2% to 10%. Use of fossil energy shrank from 68% to 62%. In 2022, renewables accounted for 30% of global electricity generation and are projected to reach over 42% by 2028. Many countries already have renewables contributing more than 20% of their total energy supply, with some generating over half or even all their electricity from renewable sources.\\nThe main motivation to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources is to slow and eventually stop climate change, which is widely agreed to be caused mostly by greenhouse gas emissions. In general, renewable energy sources cause much lower emissions than fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency estimates that to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, 90% of global electricity generation will need to be produced from renewable sources. Renewables also cause much less air pollution than fossil fuels, improving public health, and are less noisy.\\n\\nThe deployment of renewable energy still faces obstacles, especially fossil fuel subsidies, lobbying by incumbent power providers, and local opposition to the use of land for renewable installations. Like all mining, the extraction of minerals required for many renewable energy technologies also results in environmental damage. In addition, although most renewable energy sources are sustainable, some are not.',\n"," \"A battery energy storage system (BESS), battery storage power station, battery energy grid storage (BEGS) or battery grid storage is a type of energy storage technology that uses a group of batteries in the grid to store electrical energy. Battery storage is the fastest responding dispatchable source of power on electric grids, and it is used to stabilise those grids, as battery storage can transition from standby to full power in under a second to deal with grid contingencies.\\nBattery energy storage systems are generally designed to be able to output at their full rated power for several hours. Battery storage can be used for short-term peak power and ancillary services, such as providing operating reserve and frequency control to minimize the chance of power outages. They are often installed at, or close to, other active or disused power stations and may share the same grid connection to reduce costs. Since battery storage plants require no deliveries of fuel, are compact compared to generating stations and have no chimneys or large cooling systems, they can be rapidly installed and placed if necessary within urban areas, close to customer load, or even inside customer premises.\\nAs of 2021, the power and capacity of the largest individual battery storage system is an order of magnitude less than that of the largest pumped-storage power plants, the most common form of grid energy storage. For example, the Bath County Pumped Storage Station, the second largest in the world, can store 24 GWh of electricity and dispatch 3 GW while the first phase of Vistra Energy's Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility can store 1.2 GWh and dispatch 300 MW. However, grid batteries do not have to be large, a large number of smaller ones (often as hybrid power) can be widely deployed across a grid for greater redundancy and large overall capacity.\\nAs of 2019, battery power storage is typically cheaper than open cycle gas turbine power for use up to two hours, and there was around 365 GWh of battery storage deployed worldwide, growing rapidly. \\nLevelized cost of storage (LCOS) has fallen rapidly, halving in two years to reach US$150 per MWh in 2020, and further reduced to US$117 by 2023.\\n\\n\"]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":32}],"source":["api_response = []\n","\n","# Loop over multiple function calls\n","for function_call in function_calls:\n","\n","    result = search_wikipedia(function_calls)\n","\n","    # Make external API call\n","    # result = wikipedia.summary(function_call[\"search_wikipedia\"][\"query\"])\n","\n","    # Collect all API responses\n","    api_response.append(result)\n","\n","api_response"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"90340a8c2949"},"source":["### Get a natural language summary"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":33,"metadata":{"id":"3409d561a84b","outputId":"8914fe41-7dec-4e97-9e72-a80edffa57f8","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":238},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1735195724123,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":1867,"user":{"displayName":"Hangsik Shin","userId":"04632555686962088332"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"Based on my research of Wikipedia articles, here's a summary of solar panels, renewable energy, and battery storage:\n\n**Solar Panels:** Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic (PV) cells.  They are often arranged in arrays and can be used for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes.  Advantages include using a clean energy source and reducing electricity bills; disadvantages include dependence on sunlight and high initial costs.  Solar panels are frequently used in conjunction with battery storage.\n\n**Renewable Energy:** Renewable energy comes from natural resources that replenish quickly.  Common types include solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy, and geothermal.  It's a key strategy to combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.  While costs have decreased significantly, making it competitive with fossil fuels, challenges remain, such as land use and mineral extraction impacts.\n\n**Battery Storage:** Battery energy storage systems (BESS) store electrical energy from various sources, including renewable energy like solar and wind.  They help stabilize power grids by providing quick responses to fluctuations in supply and demand, preventing outages.  While currently smaller in scale than other storage methods like pumped hydro, BESS is rapidly growing and becoming more cost-effective.  The technology is crucial for integrating intermittent renewable energy sources into the grid.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"source":["# Return the API response to Gemini\n","response = chat.send_message(\n","

a summary of information about the solar system from Wikipedia:\n\n**Search Results:** The search for \"solar system\" on Wikipedia yields results including articles on the Solar System itself, its formation, lists of objects within it, and related disambiguation pages.\n\n**Variations:**  The only variation suggested by the API was \"soler system,\" which is likely a misspelling.\n\n**Summary:** The Wikipedia summary describes the solar system as a gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects orbiting it.  It details the formation of the solar system approximately 4.6 billion years ago, the Sun's characteristics as a G-type main-sequence star, and the classification of the eight planets (four terrestrial and four giant planets).  The summary also mentions dwarf planets, other small bodies (asteroids, comets, etc.), and the heliosphere, which is the boundary of the solar system's influence.  Finally, it notes the distance to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"source":["# Return the API response to Gemini\n","response = chat.send_message(\n","    [\n","        Part.from_function_response(\n","            name=\"search_wikipedia\",\n","            response={\n","                \"content\": api_response.get(\"search_wikipedia\", \"\"),\n","            },\n","        ),\n","        Part.from_function_response(\n","            name=\"suggest_wikipedia\",\n","            response={\n","                \"content\": api_response.get(\"suggest_wikipedia\", \"\"),\n","            },\n","        ),\n","        Part.from_function_response(\n","            name=\"summarize_wikipedia\",\n","            response={\n","                \"content\": api_response.get(\"summarize_wikipedia\", \"\"),\n","            },\n","        ),\n","    ],\n",")\n","\n","display(Markdown(response.text))"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"toc_visible":true,"provenance":[{"file_id":"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/function-calling/parallel_function_calling.ipynb","timestamp":1734640603038}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
