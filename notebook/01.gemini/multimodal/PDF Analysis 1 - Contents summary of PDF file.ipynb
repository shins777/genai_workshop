The report reveals that gen AI adoption has surged dramatically, with 65% of organizations now regularly using gen AI, nearly double the percentage from just ten months ago. This surge in adoption is driven by the recognition of the significant business value that gen AI can deliver, as organizations report both cost reductions and revenue increases from its implementation.\n\n**Chapter 1: AI Adoption Surges**\n\nThe first chapter examines the increasing adoption of AI across industries and regions. The report highlights that AI adoption has surged in the past year, reaching 72% of organizations, after years of relatively stagnant adoption rates. This increase is driven by the growing interest in generative AI, which has expanded the scope of AI capabilities. The graph showcases the rapid increase in AI adoption from 2017 to 2024. In 2017, AI adoption was hovering around 47%.  In 2023, it climbed to 65% and in 2024, it reached 72%. This dramatic increase is indicative of the growing interest in AI and the emergence of gen AI. It also points to a shift in how organizations are using AI, with a growing emphasis on integrating AI into more core business functions. \n\n**Chapter 2: Survey Findings Suggest Organizations Are Using AI in More Business Functions Now than in Previous Years**\n\nThe second chapter focuses on the use of AI across business functions. The report finds that organizations are increasingly using AI in multiple business functions, with half of respondents indicating that their organizations have adopted AI in at least two business functions. This represents a significant increase from 2023, where less than a third of respondents reported using AI in multiple functions. The graph shows the number of business functions using AI in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.  In 2021, 72% of respondents reported using AI in one or more business functions. That number decreased to 50% in 2023 and increased to 72% in 2024. This trend indicates that organizations are not only adopting AI but also expanding its use within their operations, seeking to leverage its benefits across a wider range of functions.\n\n**Chapter 3: Respondents Most Often Report Generative AI Adoption in Their Marketing and Sales, Product and Service Development, and IT Functions**\n\nThis chapter examines the specific business functions where generative AI is being adopted most frequently.  The report reveals that respondents are most likely to report using gen AI in marketing and sales, product and service development, and IT functions. The graph showcases the percentage of respondents reporting regular use of gen AI in various functions. The highest percentage (34%) is found in marketing and sales, followed by product and service development (23%) and IT (17%).  This data highlights the key areas where gen AI is currently having the most impact, and it points to the significant potential of gen AI to revolutionize these business functions. \n\n**Chapter 4: Respondents Are Much More Likely Now than in 2023 to Say They Are Using Generative AI**\n\nThe fourth chapter explores the pervasiveness of gen AI adoption across regions, job titles, and age groups.  The report finds that respondents are significantly more likely to report using gen AI both at work and in their personal lives compared to 2023. This trend is consistent across all regions, with the most significant increases observed in Asia-Pacific and Greater China.  The graph shows the percentage of respondents who are using AI in different ways and situations, such as using it regularly at work, regularly at work and outside of work, and having tried it at least once. In 2023, the percentage of respondents using AI regularly for work was 18%. In 2024, that number climbed to 34%. This indicates a rapid adoption of AI in professional and personal life.\n\n**Chapter 5: Investments in Gen AI and Analytical AI are Beginning to Create Value**\n\nThe fifth chapter examines the impact of gen AI and analytical AI investments on business value. The report finds that, across many industries, organizations are equally likely to invest more than 5% of their digital budgets in both gen AI and analytical AI. The report also explores the value creation achieved through the use of gen AI, with the largest share of respondents reporting cost reductions in human resources and revenue increases in supply chain and inventory management.  The graphs show the percentage of organizations investing more than 5% of their digital budgets in gen AI and analytical AI. In both categories, the percentages are fairly similar, with the technology sector showing a higher percentage for gen AI and the financial services sector showing a higher percentage for analytical AI. This indicates that organizations are increasingly investing in both forms of AI to capture their respective benefits.\n\n**Chapter 6: Looking Ahead, Most Respondents (67%) Expect Their Organizations to Invest More in AI over the Next Three Years**\n\nThe report concludes by emphasizing the continued optimism surrounding AI investment. The majority of respondents (67%) expect their organizations to invest more in AI over the next three years, signaling a robust outlook for AI adoption and development in the years to come.\n\nThe report concludes that, while gen AI is still in its early stages, organizations are already seeing significant benefits from its adoption. However, there are also risks associated with the use of gen AI, with inaccuracy being the most frequently cited concern. Organizations are increasingly focusing on developing and implementing best practices to mitigate these risks and capture the full value of gen AI.  High performers are setting the standard for responsible AI implementation, focusing on data governance, risk mitigation, and strategic deployment.  The report emphasizes the importance of continued investment in AI and suggests that organizations should focus on building their own customized AI models to gain a competitive advantage.  This report indicates that AI adoption is accelerating and generating tangible value for organizations. However, organizations must be vigilant in managing risks and developing best practices to unlock the full potential of AI.  The report highlights the importance of collaboration, strategic planning, and a focus on value creation to ensure the successful and responsible implementation of AI across all industries."},"metadata":{}}]}]}
