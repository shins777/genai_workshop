Rainbows are a beautiful result of sunlight and water droplets working together. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Sunlight:**  Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow, but we usually see it as white light.\n\n2. **Water Droplets:** When rain falls, tiny water droplets are suspended in the air.\n\n3. **Refraction and Reflection:**  As sunlight passes through a water droplet, it bends (refracts).  This bending separates the white light into its individual colors.  Then, the light reflects off the back of the droplet and bends again as it leaves. \n\n4. **Angle is Key:**  For us to see a rainbow, the angle between the sun, the water droplet, and our eye needs to be just right. This is why we usually see rainbows after it rains, when the sun is shining and there are still water droplets in the air.\n\n5. **Your View:**  The rainbow you see is actually a reflection of the sunlight in the water droplets. It's like a giant, colorful reflection in the sky!\n\nSo, the next time you see a rainbow, remember that it's a beautiful display of science in action! ðŸŒˆâœ¨\n"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","Elapsed Time : 2.122877307999943 seconds\n","\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Clear chat history\n","\n","chat.history.clear()\n","\n","history = \" \".join([content.text for content in chat.history])\n","print(f\"Chat history : {history}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ZOeUA-M4KIeK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724734048099,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":353,"user":{"displayName":"Hangsik Shin","userId":"04632555686962088332"}},"outputId":"2b3d81a1-dadb-4992-b558-b014ef1d9fcc"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Chat history : \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["history = \" \".join([content.text for content in chat.history])\n","print(f\"Chat history : {history}\")\n","\n","interactive_chat(chat, \"Why does it appear when it rains?.\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":221},"id":"VCrsAIR9KTaV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724734064684,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":2393,"user":{"displayName":"Hangsik Shin","userId":"04632555686962088332"}},"outputId":"49c8ccc0-7ccd-4403-e3de-aa8eefe1b16f"},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Chat history : \n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"Question : Why does it appear when it rains?."},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"Answer : Please provide more context!  \"It\" is very vague.
