Rainbows appear when sunlight interacts with water droplets in the air, like after a rain shower. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Sunlight:**  Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow, but we see it as white light.\n2. **Water Droplets:**  When sunlight hits a raindrop, it enters the droplet and bends (refracts).  Each color of light bends at a slightly different angle.\n3. **Reflection:** Inside the raindrop, the light bounces off the back of the droplet.\n4. **More Refraction:**  As the light leaves the raindrop, it bends again, separating the colors even further.\n5. **Our Eyes:**  Since each color of light is now traveling at a slightly different angle, we see them as a distinct band of colors â€“ a rainbow!\n\n**Important Note:** To see a rainbow, the sun needs to be behind you and the rain in front of you. The angle between the sun, you, and the rain needs to be about 42 degrees. \n\nLet me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any of these steps!  ðŸ˜Š \n"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Time : 2.642939802000001 seconds\n","\n","\n"]}]}]}
