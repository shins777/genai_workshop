That's a great question!  A rainbow appears when sunlight interacts with water droplets in the air, like after a rain shower. Here's a breakdown of what happens:\n","\n","1. **Sunlight:**  Sunlight is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow, but we see it as white because all those colors are mixed together.\n","2. **Water Droplets:** When sunlight hits water droplets in the air, it gets refracted, or bent. This bending causes the different colors of light to separate, like when light passes through a prism.\n","3. **Reflection:** The light then reflects off the back of the water droplet.\n","4. **Second Refraction:** The reflected light is bent again as it exits the droplet. This second refraction further separates the colors, making them more distinct.\n","\n","**The key is the angle:**  You only see a rainbow when the sunlight hits the water droplets at a specific angle (around 42 degrees). That's why you often see rainbows after a rainstorm, but not always. You also need the sun to be behind you and the rain in front of you for the light to bend and reflect correctly. \n","\n","So, a rainbow is a beautiful reminder of how sunlight and water droplets work together to create a colorful spectacle!  🌈\n","\n","---------------- Current Chat ---------------- \n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"Question : Why does it appear when it rains?."},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"Answer : You're right!
