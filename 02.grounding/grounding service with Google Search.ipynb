Politics are constantly evolving, and movies generally take time to develop and release, making it hard to find something truly up-to-the-minute. \n\nHowever, I can recommend some films that explore themes relevant to Korean politics and societal issues that often influence political discourse:\n\n**For a general understanding of Korean society and its complexities:**\n\n* **\"Parasite\" (2019):** This Oscar-winning film is a powerful allegory for class inequality and social mobility in South Korea. While not directly political, it sheds light on the societal tensions that often fuel political debates.\n* **\"Burning\" (2018):** A haunting thriller that examines themes of social alienation, class disparity, and the struggles of young people in a rapidly changing Korea.\n\n**For a closer look at specific historical events or political figures:**\n\n* **\"The Handmaiden\" (2016):** Based on a novel, this erotic thriller set during the Japanese occupation of Korea explores themes of power, manipulation, and the complexities of identity.\n* **\"1987: When the Day Comes\" (2017):** A powerful historical drama about the 1987 pro-democracy protests, highlighting the struggles for democracy and human rights in Korea.\n* **\"The Age of Shadows\" (2016):** A historical action thriller set during the Japanese occupation of Korea, focusing on the fight for independence and the complexities of resistance.\n\n**For a more contemporary perspective:**\n\n* **\"Train to Busan\" (2016):** While a zombie movie, it features themes of social inequality and government incompetence, reflecting some anxieties about Korean society.\n* **\"The King\" (2017):** A political thriller about a prosecutor who rises to power through ambition and ruthless tactics, offering a critical look at corruption and power dynamics within Korean politics.\n* **\"The Spy Gone North\" (2018):** Based on a true story, this film focuses on a North Korean spy who infiltrates South Korea, offering a glimpse into the ongoing tensions and ideological differences between the two Koreas.\n\nRemember, these are just starting points. It's always good to research further based on your specific interests and desired depth of exploration. You can find many documentaries, dramas, and films on streaming platforms that cover diverse perspectives on Korean politics and society. \n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Configuration Google Search"],"metadata":{"id":"p-c1zj7oZl5o"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def get_response(prompt:str)->str:\n","\n","  tool = Tool.from_google_search_retrieval(grounding.GoogleSearchRetrieval())\n","\n","  response = model.generate_content(\n","      prompt,\n","      tools=[tool],\n","      generation_config=GenerationConfig(\n","          temperature=0.0,\n","      ),\n","  )\n","\n","  return response.text\n"],"metadata":{"id":"N6uf6k1YdQ7n","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733971365020,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":255,"user":{"displayName":"Hangsik Shin","userId":"04632555686962088332"}}},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["outcome = get_response(PROMPT)\n","display(Markdown(outcome))"],"metadata":{"id":"PpHxsm_odQ4p","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":284},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733971370220,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":3337,"user":{"displayName":"Hangsik Shin","userId":"04632555686962088332"}},"outputId":"81e5b5de-c211-4fd8-f49e-24383f979fed"},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"It's difficult to recommend a specific movie that perfectly reflects the current Korean political situation, as movies often focus on historical events or fictionalized scenarios.
